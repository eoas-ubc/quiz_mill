It is emitting 250 W/m2 (see below) The wall can't change its temperature because of the 2nd law, so it has
to absorb as much as it emits

The following figure shows an atmosphere that is **black** in the long wave, **transparent** in the visible, over a surface that appears black at all wavelengths. If the ground is at $290$ K and the system is in equilibrium, approximately what is the temperature of the atmosphere?

We know that the system is in equilibrium, so fluxes must be in balance at both the top and bottom levels.  that means that $I_a$ = -$I_{in}$ at the top, and $I_g$ = -2 $I_{in}$ at the bottom.  We know $I_g$ since we are given $T_g$.

This graph shows the flows of carbon into and out of the atmosphere since 1900. Using the information on the graph, identify all **CORRECT** statements from the list below.

* The stock of C in the atmosphere has increased continually since 1900.  
* The stock of C in the atmosphere is currently higher than it has been at any time since 1900.  
* From 1900 to about 1950, the stock of C in the atmosphere remained constant.  
* The rate at which C has been accumulating has remained approximately constant since 1900.  
* Around 1970s, there was an abrupt drop in the stock of C.

850 W/m^2. First find the flux using Stefan Boltzman, then find the power going through  the star's
surface (in Watts).  Then since power is conserved heading out to the planent, find the flux at the planet by spreading that power on to the sphere area at the planet's
orbit.

Subtract the bottom from the top, accounting for signs and rearrange.
Note that the answer agrees with intuition -- it's losing energy out the top and the bottom
(first term) and gaining energy by absorbing the flux from layer 1 (second term).
