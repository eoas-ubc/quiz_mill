# # Environment setup
# If you are running on your own machine, you may want to set up a local environment. The below instructions assume you are using conda.
#
# ---
# ## Before you start
# Know the basics of Conda (see [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)).
#
# ## Install Conda
# - macOS users: [Installing on macOS](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html)
# - Windows users: [Installing on Windows](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html)
# - Linux users: [Installing on Linux](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html)
#
# ## Creating the environment from the environment.yml file
# 1. Open your terminal
# 2. `cd` to the outermost quiz_mill/ folder
# 3. Enter the following command in your terminal: ```$ conda create```
# 4. Activate the environment: ```$ conda activate quiz-mill``` 
#
# ## Installing the command-line utilities
# To use commands like `filter-notebook` and `generate-notebooks`, we need to install them first.
#
# 1. `cd` to the outermost quiz_mill/ folder
# 2. Enter the following code into the terminal:  
# ```$ pip install .```
